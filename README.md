# Nigeria's Interest in Foreign Languages – Google Trends Analysis

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** exploring Nigerians’ interest in French, Spanish, German, and Mandarin, based on Google Trends data.

## 🔍 Overview
I built this personal mini-project to combine my love of languages (currently learning Spanish, Finnish, and Japanese on Duolingo) with my data analytics skills.
Language skills open doors to scholarships, jobs, and global opportunities and my focus was on French, Spanish, German, and Mandarin for this project.

I wanted to explore: “What level of interest do Nigerians have in learning foreign languages that are in demand for careers?”
This project shows how interest in these languages varies across Nigeria’s 36 states and regions.
